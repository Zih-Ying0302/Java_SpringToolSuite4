# Java_SpringToolSuite4
An simple guild for beginner. Yeah, for example, ME. (＊◕ᴗ◕＊) 

# Start!
## Install  
Install Spring tool suite 4 from [here](https://spring.io/tools). Here I use **Spring Tools 4 for Eclipse** and select the windows version.  
The file you download is a "**.jar**" file. You can double click it to extract it.  
- But there is some question to me. So I download it from [HERE](https://github.com/spring-projects/sts4/wiki/Previous-Versions), and download the "**.zip**" file at the 2**nd** point.


## HelloWorld  
1. Select "File" -> "New" -> "Java Project"  
2. Create a project named "HelloWorld" then click "Finish". Then you can see a "HelloWorld" file in "Package Explorer" at the left side pannel.  
3. Expand it and expand the source file (src), then right click src -> "New" -> "Class"  
4. Create a class named "HelloWorld", and tick the "public static void main(String[] args)" (This is not always necessary) -> "Finish"  
5. You can see a "HelloWorld.java" file, and we add ```System.out.println("Hello World!");``` below *// TODO Auto-generated method stub*.  
6. Click "save" or "save all" (usually choose this) on the tools bar (the 2nd and 3rd icon).  
7. Right click "HelloWorld.java" -> "Run As" -> "Java Application"
